## Copilot Certainly! To obtain the binary_image using adaptive thresholding, 
you can use the cv2.adaptiveThreshold() function. Here's the syntax: 
import cv2 # Load your grayscale image (replace 'your_image.jpg' 
with the actual path) img = cv2.imread('your_image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE) 
# Set the parameters for adaptive thresholding blockSize = 11 
# Adjust this based on your image characteristics C = 2 
# Adjust this as needed 
# Apply adaptive thresholding binary_image = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(img, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY, blockSize, C) 
In this code snippet: - cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C calculates the threshold as the mean of the neighborhood area. - 
You can also use cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C for a weighted mean. - Adjust blockSize and C according to your specific image. 
Remember to replace 'your_image.jpg' with the actual path to your image file.
