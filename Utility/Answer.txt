Certainly! Here's a Python function that randomly selects a specified number of pixels from an image using the PIL library:

from PIL import Image
import random

def select_random_pixels(image_path, num_pixels=2):
    """
    Randomly selects pixels from an image and returns their RGB values.

    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the image file.
        num_pixels (int): Number of pixels to select (default is 2).

    Returns:
        list: List of RGB tuples for the selected pixels.
    """
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    image = image.convert("RGB")

    selected_pixels = []
    for _ in range(num_pixels):
        x = random.randint(0, image.width - 1)
        y = random.randint(0, image.height - 1)
        selected_pixels.append(image.getpixel((x, y)))

    return selected_pixels

# Example usage:
image_path = "your_image.jpg"
selected_rgb_values = select_random_pixels(image_path, num_pixels=2)
for i, rgb in enumerate(selected_rgb_values, start=1):
    print(f"Pixel {i}: RGB = {rgb}")

Replace "your_image.jpg" with the actual path to your image file. You can call this function with different values for num_pixels to select more or fewer pixels. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
