Certainly! To get the brightness of the two randomly selected pixels and rank them, follow these steps:
- Calculate Brightness:
    - For each pixel, calculate the average brightness using the formula:
$$ \text{{brightness}} = \frac{{R + G + B}}{3} $$
    - Alternatively, use the standard luminance formula:
$$ \text{{Luminance}} = 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B $$
- Rank the Pixels:
    - Compare the brightness values of the two pixels.
    - The pixel with the higher brightness value is the brightest.
Here's an example Python code snippet to achieve this:

from PIL import Image
import random

def calculate_brightness(pixel):
    r, g, b = pixel
    return (r + g + b) // 3

def main(image_path):
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    image = image.convert("RGB")

    # Randomly select 2 pixels
    selected_pixels = []
    for _ in range(2):
        x = random.randint(0, image.width - 1)
        y = random.randint(0, image.height - 1)
        selected_pixels.append(image.getpixel((x, y)))

    # Calculate brightness for each selected pixel
    brightness_values = [calculate_brightness(pixel) for pixel in selected_pixels]

    # Rank the pixels
    brightest_pixel_index = brightness_values.index(max(brightness_values))
    print(f"Pixel 1 brightness: {brightness_values[0]}")
    print(f"Pixel 2 brightness: {brightness_values[1]}")
    print(f"Brightest pixel: Pixel {brightest_pixel_index + 1}")

# Example usage:
image_path = "your_image.jpg"
main(image_path)

Replace "your_image.jpg" with the actual path to your image file. This code will calculate the brightness and rank the pixels accordingly. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
